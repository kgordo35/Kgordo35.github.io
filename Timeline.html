        <p><h2><b>The Creation of Cookies</b></h2></p>
            <p class="intro">
                The First web browser cookie was designed by Lou Montulli in 1994. Montulli
                 at the time was employed at Netscape Communications which during the 1990's was 
                 one of the leading companies in web browser development. The cookie that Montulli designed
                 was the shopping cart cookie. This cookie allowed users to add items to their online shopping cart
                 while maintaing the items a user added to their shopping cart even if they were to navigate away from the
                 website. One year later Montulli secured the patent for the cookie and was later added to Internet Explorer. Within two
                 years of the creation of the first web browser cookie, third-party cookies were created. 
                 Once cookies became a staple element in web browsing users began to have concerns about how much information 
                 cookies were collecting and how that information was being used. The first article published on this
                 was released in 1996 by the Financial Times. Follwing this article organizations such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
                 advised Netscape and Internet Explorer via the <a href=https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2109>RFC 2109</a> to allow users to
                  have substantial control over cookies. However neither Netscape nor Internet Explorer implemented these changes.
                  As time went on more and more third-party cookies were being created for the use of tracking users behaviors and information
                  for the use of advertising purposes. For a little over a decade there was little to no regulation on third-party cookies and how users
                  could control them. In 2010 The Wall Street Journal published a 
                  <a href=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703977004575393173432219064>story</a> with an experiment that brought to light just
                   how pervasive these third-party cookies were. The experiment conducted found that "50 sites checked by TWSJ have installed 3,000 tracking
                   files on the computer used in the study"(Bober, 2023). That is an average of 60 files per site visited. A year after this article was published
                   the FTC implemented a law that stated that users must be aware if a third-party cookie is active on their device.
